When making a request over HTTPS, HTTPX needs to verify the identity of the requested host. To do this, it uses a bundle of SSL certificates (a.k.a. CA bundle) delivered by a trusted certificate authority (CA).

### Enabling and disabling verification

By default httpx will verify HTTPS connections, and raise an error for invalid SSL cases...

```pycon
>>> httpx.get("https://expired.badssl.com/")
httpx.ConnectError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: certificate has expired (_ssl.c:997)
```

You can disable SSL verification completely and allow insecure requests...

```pycon
>>> httpx.get("https://expired.badssl.com/", verify=False)
<Response [200 OK]>
```

### Configuring client instances

If you're using a `Client()` instance you should pass any `verify=<...>` configuration when instantiating the client.

By default the [certifi CA bundle](https://certifiio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is used for SSL verification.

For more complex configurations you can pass an [SSL Context](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html) instance...

```python
import certifi
import httpx
import ssl

# This SSL context is equivalent to the default `verify=True`.
ctx = ssl.create_default_context(cafile=certifi.where())
client = httpx.Client(verify=ctx)
```

Using [the `truststore` package](https://truststore.readthedocs.io/) to support system certificate stores...

```python
import ssl
import truststore
import httpx

# Use system certificate stores.
ctx = truststore.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT)
client = httpx.Client(verify=ctx)
```

Loading an alternative certificate verification store using [the standard SSL context API](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html)...

```python
import httpx
import ssl

# Use an explicitly configured certificate store.
ctx = ssl.create_default_context(cafile="path/to/certs.pem")  # Either cafile or capath.
client = httpx.Client(verify=ctx)
```

### Client side certificates

Client side certificates allow a remote server to verify the client. They tend to be used within private organizations to authenticate requests to remote servers.

You can specify client-side certificates, using the [`.load_cert_chain()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext.load_cert_chain) API...

```python
ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
ctx.load_cert_chain(certfile="path/to/client.pem")  # Optionally also keyfile or password.
client = httpx.Client(verify=ctx)
```

### Working with `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR`

`httpx` does respect the `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR` environment variables by default. For details, refer to [the section on the environment variables page](../environment_variables.md#ssl_cert_file).

### Making HTTPS requests to a local server

When making requests to local servers, such as a development server running on `localhost`, you will typically be using unencrypted HTTP connections.

If you do need to make HTTPS connections to a local server, for example to test an HTTPS-only service, you will need to create and use your own certificates. Here's one way to do it...

1. Use [trustme](https://github.com/python-trio/trustme) to generate a pair of server key/cert files, and a client cert file.
2. Pass the server key/cert files when starting your local server. (This depends on the particular web server you're using. For example, [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org) provides the `--ssl-keyfile` and `--ssl-certfile` options.)
3. Configure `httpx` to use the certificates stored in `client.pem`.

```python
ctx = ssl.create_default_context(cafile="client.pem")
client = httpx.Client(verify=ctx)
```
